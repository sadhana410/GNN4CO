# GNN4CO
Several problems of combinatorial nature, such as graph colouring, identifying the maximum independent set, calculating minimum vertex cover or maximum clique belong to the complexity class NP-hard. These form the original underlying problems that occur in applications of scheduling, timetabling, resource allocation, network design and bioinformatics. The omnipresence of combinatorial optimisation (CO) problems makes efforts to solve them faster desirable. Interestingly, these problems are polynomial time solvable for certain special classes of graphs like bipartite graphs or interval graphs. Their solvability can be attributed to the structural and graph-theoretic properties of the special graph classes. The work aims to analyse whether Graph Neural Networks (GNN) follow a similar tendency of enhanced learning and predictions in case of inputs modeled as instances of such special graph classes. Specifically, we investigate whether generic structural features contribute sufficiently to GNN-based predictions, allowing for generalization beyond special graph classes to arbitrary graphs. A comparison of results from learning and prediction with existing methodologies is done for some known NP-hard problems.
